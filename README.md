# Projects

An index of active open-source research projects maintained under **AutonomousGeoAI4Science**.

Some projects in this collection are adapted, extended, or inspired by existing open geospatial and GeoAI initiatives. We gratefully acknowledge prior work and community contributions, including projects from the broader open-source geospatial ecosystem (e.g., https://github.com/giswqs and https://github.com/opengeos).

All listed projects aim to advance reproducible research, open science, and responsible development in GeoAI and spatial intelligence.
